My first project. Simple app to keep track of expenses with UI. 

It's Java project that a wrote from scratch, with UI. I tried to develop from diagram to working app.
Here I used GitHub to work with my project, add branches, modify and marge, used two computers to get experience of real life project.
Working version is ready, and now I'm starting to use it and collect feedback.

What I used on this project:
Swing UI. JDBC to work with H2 embedded database. JUnit to test and Maven.

Version 0.1
Can't save information after closing the app.

Version 0.2

Version 0.2.1
Saving data to separate files for each month.

Version 0.4
Added database to save user data.

Version 0.4.1
Added possibility to open table of past expenses.
